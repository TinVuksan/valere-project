Starting the project locally requires you to create a `.env.development` file and add environment variables based on the provided `.env.template` file.

### Without docker

If you wish to start the project locally without Docker, after you created your `.env.development` file, simply run

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
